1. Specific pose, knees together and face camera directly
2. Skin tight clothes are very good and basically a necessity
3. Solid background
4. Stand straight up and down - AS SYMMETRICAL AS POSSIBLE
5. Picture at waist level
6. Avoid 0.5, use 1x lens
7. Good lighting

We should build a feature for the camera to make it as helpful/easy as possible

Check list:
Lower leg length: GOOD
Lower leg width: GOOD

Upper leg length: GOOD
Upper leg width: GOOD

Lower arm length: DECENT
Lower arm width: BAD

Upper arm length: GOOD
Upper arm width: BAD

Torso width: DECENT (Find better method than right and left shoulder, maybe avg of hips and shoulders?)
Torso length/height: BAD (WTF NOSE AND HEEL)

ALL DEPTHS ARE TRASH RN, FIX LENGHT/WIDTH BEFORE TACKLING
HOWEVER, WIDTH CAN BE CONSIDERED DEPTH FOR NOW^^^ **********

TORSO WIDTH SHOULD BE AROUND 15-18ish
HEIGHT SHOULD BE 20-22

TORSO DEPTH :( VERY ANNOYING
